     ‚îú‚îÄ Pin 2 (5V Enable)     ‚îú‚îÄ Power        ‚îú‚îÄ WiFi Connection

     ‚îî‚îÄ Pin 6 (GND)           ‚îî‚îÄ Signal Inv.  ‚îî‚îÄ MQTT (optional)
```

## üìà Configuration Options

### Power Class Thresholds
```yaml
# Customize power exceed monitoring
- lambda: |-
    // Change these values to match your contract
    double exceed_3kw = power > 3000 ? (power - 3000) * 10.0 / 3600.0 : 0.0;
    double exceed_7kw = power > 7000 ? (power - 7000) * 10.0 / 3600.0 : 0.0;
    double exceed_12kw = power > 12000 ? (power - 12000) * 10.0 / 3600.0 : 0.0;
```

### Cost Calculations
```yaml
# Update cost per kWh for your region
- lambda: |-
    return id(exceed_class_3kw_day_kwh) * 0.1139;  # ‚Ç¨0.1139 per kWh
```

### Statistical Window
```yaml
# Change 15-minute window (90 samples at 10s intervals)
globals:
  - id: power_consumption_buffer
    type: double[90]  # Adjust size: 90 = 15min, 180 = 30min
```

## üì° **MQTT Last Will and Testament (LWT)**

### **What is LWT?**
Last Will and Testament is an MQTT protocol feature that ensures reliable device status monitoring:

- **Birth Message**: Published as "online" when the device successfully connects to MQTT broker
- **Will Message**: Automatically published as "offline" by the broker if the device disconnects unexpectedly
- **Retain Flag**: Status messages are retained so new subscribers immediately know device status
- **Topic**: Published to `{topic_prefix}/status` (e.g., `lamsmarty/status`)

### **How It Works**
```yaml
# MQTT LWT Configuration (in MQTT enhanced version)
mqtt:
  birth_message:
    topic: lamsmarty/status
    payload: "online"      # Published when device connects
    retain: true
  will_message:
    topic: lamsmarty/status
    payload: "offline"     # Published by broker if device disconnects
    retain: true
```

### **Why Important for ESP Devices?**
ESP devices can disconnect due to:
- Power outages or brownouts
- WiFi connectivity issues
- Device crashes or freezes
- Physical disconnection

LWT ensures your home automation system knows the device status even when the device can't send a manual "goodbye" message.

### **Monitoring in Home Assistant**
```yaml
# Create a binary sensor to monitor device status
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "SmartyReader Status"
    state_topic: "lamsmarty/status"
    payload_on: "online"
    payload_off: "offline"
    device_class: connectivity
```

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

### Automatic Discovery
All sensors automatically appear in Home Assistant with proper device classes:
- **Energy**: kWh sensors with `total_increasing` state class
- **Power**: W sensors with `measurement` state class  
- **Voltage/Current**: V/A sensors with appropriate device classes
- **Environmental**: Temperature, humidity, pressure sensors

### Custom Dashboards
Create energy dashboards using the enhanced sensors:
```yaml
# Energy dashboard card example
type: energy-date-selection
title: Energy Usage
entities:
  - sensor.energy_consumed_today
  - sensor.energy_produced_today
  - sensor.cost_exceed_3kw_today
```

### Automations
Use power exceed sensors for smart home automation:
```yaml
# Example automation for high power usage
automation:
  - alias: "High Power Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.power_consumed
        above: 7000
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Power usage exceeds 7kW!"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No DSMR Data Received**
   - Check P1 cable connections
   - Verify DSMR decryption key
   - Use test mode configuration for debugging

2. **Incorrect Power Values**
   - Verify signal inversion in UART configuration
   - Check for interference on UART lines
   - Review raw data using test mode

3. **Statistical Calculations Not Working**
   - Ensure sufficient uptime for buffer fill
   - Check global variable initialization
   - Verify interval timers are running

4. **Status LED Not Working / Random Flickering**
   - **CRITICAL**: Cannot use both `hardware_uart: UART1` and `status_led` on same pin
   - **Solution**: Comment out `hardware_uart: UART1` in logger section
   - **Pin Conflict**: D4 (GPIO2) used by both UART1 TX and built-in LED
   - **Result**: Logger works via WiFi, status LED functions properly

### Debug Mode
Enable comprehensive logging:
```yaml
logger:
  level: VERBOSE
  logs:
    dsmr: VERBOSE
    sensor: DEBUG
```

### Test Mode Features
- Raw P1 data inspection (hex dump)
- Telegram reception counting
- Connection status monitoring
- Error detection and logging
